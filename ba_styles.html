                <li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Fruity esters can contribute to the character of these beers. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of Old Ales is that they undergo an aging process, often for years. Aging can occur on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle. This contributes to a rich, wine-like, and often sweet, oxidized character. Complex estery attributes may also emerge. Diacetyl is usually absent in these beers but may be present at very low levels.</li>

Attributes arising from liquids previously aged in a barrel, such as bourbon or sherry, should not be present. Beers that exhibit such attributes are categorized as wood- and barrel-aged beers.<br>	<em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, competition organizers may choose to split this category into subcategories which reflect strong and very strong versions, or historic and modern versions.</em></li>

Lactose should not lend to, or overwhelm, the flavor character of these beers. The term juicy is frequently used to describe taste and aroma hop-derived attributes often present in these beers which result from late, often very large, additions of hops. A juicy character is not required, however. Likewise the term hazy is frequently used to describe the appearance of many examples of these beers. However, some versions may exhibit very low cloudiness. Other hop-derived attributes such as citrus, pine, spice, floral or others may be present with or without the presence of juicy attributes. These beers may sometimes exhibit astringency and/or heat (often referred to as hop burn) as a result of very high hop usage rates and excessive contact time in beer, which can detract from balance and drinkability when present above low levels. Versions of this style brewed with darker malts, non-traditional ale yeasts, fruits, spices, or other flavorings are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ale.	</li>

Corn grits or flakes were commonly used at a rate or 25-35% of the total grist. Minerally attributes resulted from the use of hard brewing water. These beers were consumed very young, going from brewhouse to consumer in as little as one week. Early 20th century brewing literature mentions a slight tartness developing during fermentation as a characteristic attribute of this style. If tartness is present in modern versions, it should be at very low levels.	</li>

                <li><strong>Fermentation Characteristics:</strong> Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic aromas and flavors derived from <i>Brettanomyces</i> yeast are often present at moderate levels. High to very high fruity esters are present. Traditionally, Lambics are unblended and spontaneously fermented. They express high to very high levels of fruity esters from <i>Brettanomyces</i> and other yeasts, as well as bacteria and wild yeast-derived sourness. Their primary sour character should be lactic. A slight amount of acetic sourness may sometimes be present but should never be harsh or overwhelming. Some modern versions are fermented with the addition of cultured yeast and bacteria. Carbonation can range from absent to very low. Wood-derived flavors may range from low to medium. Wood-vanillin, if present, should be low.</li>

Versions of this beer style made outside of the Brussels area cannot be called true Lambics. These versions are said to be Belgian-Style Lambic and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional Lambic is dry and very well-attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, or other sweeteners. Sweet modern versions may be created through the addition of sugars or other sweeteners, in which case sweetness should be restrained and balanced by complexity and acidity. Traditionally, Lambics are brewed with unmalted wheat and malted barley. A pleasant lactic acidity should be present. Acetic acid character, if present, should be minimal.	</li>

Belgian-Style Fruit Beers are fermented with traditional Belgian yeast, (Wit, Abbey, Farmhouse, etc.). Fruit or fruit extracts, used as adjuncts in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, provide harmonious fruit character ranging from subtle to intense. Classifying these beers can be complex. Within the framework of these guidelines, coconut is defined as a vegetable, and a beer containing coconut is categorized as Field Beer. Likewise a beer containing chili peppers is categorized as Chili Beer. Because wood vessels may be used for fermentation or aging, attributes typical of wood-aging such as vanillin, or from liquids previously aged in wood may be present. Fruited Belgian-style beers which exhibit <i>Brettanomyces</i> may be categorized in this style. However, a fruited Saison exhibiting Brett character should be categorized as a Specialty Saison. A fruited version of a Brett Beer is categorized as Fruited Brett Beer when such a Brett-containing beer is not based on an existing underlying Belgian beer style. A Lambic-Style fruit beer should be categorized as a Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic. Fruited Belgian-Style beers brewed with additional adjuncts could fall in this category or perhaps as Experimental Beers. Fruit beers fermented with German, British or American ale or lager yeast should be categorized as American-Style Fruit Beers or as Fruit Wheat Beers.<br>	<em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries.

Fruit Lambics, whose origin is the Brussels area of Belgium, are often simply called Fruit Lambic. Versions of this beer style made outside of the Brussels area are said to be Belgian-Style Fruit Lambics. The Belgian-style versions are made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional Lambics are dry and well-attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit, or other sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars, or other sweeteners. See also Belgian-Style Lambic for additional background information. Vanillin and other wood-derived flavors may range from absent to present at up to low-medium levels, and, if present, are in harmony with attribute arising from fruit.<br>	<em>Competition organizers may create subcategories which reflect groups of entries based on color, fruit, or other ingredients. When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries.

A brewer may brew any type of beer of any strength and enhance its character with various aging conditions for an extended time. In general, beers with high hopping rates, roast malt, high alcohol content, and complex herbal, smoke or fruit character are the best candidates for aging. Aged Beers may be aged in bottles, cans, kegs or other non-wooden vessels. Aged character may be expressed in mouthfeel, aroma, and flavor. Often, aged character is the result of oxidative reactions that either bring individual flavor components into harmony or are unique flavors unto themselves. Sherry-like and fruity flavors often develop during aging, and hop character often changes. No matter what the effect, the overall character should be balanced and without aggressive flavors. The level of change created by aging will vary with the duration of aging and the underlying beer style. Mildly-flavored beers are more likely to develop aggressive and unpleasant oxidation. Positive transformations are more likely to occur in beers with higher levels of hops, malt, or alcohol.</li>

                <li>    <strong>Additional notes:</strong>    Beers in this category build on a strong dark beer base and incorporate culinary ingredients to create rich, sweet flavor profiles mimicking the character of desserts, pastries or candies. Examples of culinary ingredients used in these beers include, but are not limited to, chocolate, coffee, coconut, vanilla, maple syrup, peanut butter and marshmallow as well as fruits, nuts and spices. The addition of sugars from any source may contribute to the pronounced sweetness of these beers. While this category may overlap several other styles defined in these guidelines such as Chocolate or Cocoa Beers, Coffee Beers, Field beers, and others, the combination of a high-gravity beer base, elevated alcohol content and rich, sweet, dessert-like flavor profiles sets this style apart as a unique entity. Wood or barrel-aged versions of these beers are classified elsewhere.<br>	<em>When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style(s) being made to higher alcoholic strength, or other information unique to the entry such as ingredients or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes such as microflora, fruit, spices, or other ingredients, etc.</em></li>
